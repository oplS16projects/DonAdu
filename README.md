# Project Title: FTG- Fractal Turtle Graphics

### Statement
Math/Calculus students, and students of Computer Science (especially those in Computing 4 with Fred Martin) will deal with recursive functions- Fibonacci's Sequence, Fractals, etc. FTG aims to provide a resource where students may find visual examples of such functions, and are able to watch second by second as the fractals are drawn.

### Analysis
Primarily, we will be using recursion in the fractal drawing algorithms. At this time, we do not believe anything else will be used to an extent as thorough as recursion.

### Data set or other source materials
The data used will be input from the user.

### Deliverable and Demonstration

We will be able to enter input into the webpage and then the image will be created in a new tab. Taking user input, the new tab will have an animated, step by step drawing of the fractal diagram, as specified by the user input data- how many recursions, what shape will be used.

We will have three shapes that we can select on the webpage- Triangles, Squares, and Circles, that can be selected by the user. The new tabs will display either blank or an error message. As it is a visual process, the live demo will be interactive, and we can ask for input from the class.

### Evaluation of Results
Success of our project will be measured by three objectives:

1) The successful merge between the drawing algorithms and the webpage itself through html commands

2) If the fractals are animated when they draw, second by second

3) If the commands on the webpage successfully open new tabs dedicated to the animated fractal drawings

## Architecture Diagram

A Webpage and fractal image generator will work together to provide a educational "growing" image that can be used by students to better understand recursion. The Webpage will be interactive with the user and accept input. That input will include the number recursions deep it will go and also the shapes that will be used to build the image. Other feature are possible if time permits.

The fractal image generator will take in parameters that it recieved from the webpage. With these parameters it will put it in a algorithm and recursively build the image one step at a time. I will send a series of images back to the webpage to be displayed to the user as a "growing" image as it is animated.

## Schedule

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
The completed outlines of the website and fractal drawing algorithms will be ready for the first milestone, Friday April 15th.

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
The Fractal algorithms will be implemented into the webpage for the second milestone, Friday April 22nd, and the webpage will be complete.

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
A fully-working webpage and interactive demo will be ready for presentation to the class.

## Group Responsibilities

### Patrick Donegan @PDD-GIT
Will develop the fractal image generator. The generator will take in a set of specs from a webpage, such as the number of levels of recursion and the shapes to be used in the drawing. The image will then be created and sent out to the webpage. 

### Leonard Lambda @lennylambda
will work on...

### John Adams @jadamsuml 
John is team lead, and is responsible for the integration between the webpage and drawing algorithms, and assisting other team members where necessary.
