# Project Title: FTG- Fractal Turtle Graphics

### Statement
Math/Calculus students, and students of Computer Science (especially those in Computing 4 with Fred Martin) will deal with recursive functions- Fibonacci's Sequence, Fractals, etc. FTG aims to provide a resource where students may find visual examples of such functions, and are able to watch second by second as the fractals are drawn.

### Analysis
Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the project. Be explicit: e.g., will you use recursion? How? Will you use map/filter/reduce? How? Will you use data abstraction? Will you use object-orientation? Will you use functional approaches to processing your data? Will you use state-modification approaches? A combination?

The idea here is to identify what ideas from the class you will use in carrying out your project. 

### Data set or other source materials
If you will be working with existing data, where will you get those data from? (Dowload it from a website? access it in a database? create it in a simulation you will build....)

How will you convert that data into a form usable for your project?  

Do your homework here: if you are pulling data from somewhere, actually go download it and look at it. Explain in some detail what your plan is for accomplishing the necessary processing.

If you are using some other starting materails, explain what they are. Basically: anything you plan to use that isn't code.

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

### Evaluation of Results
We will measure success of the results by three parameters:
1) How successful the merge between the fractal drawing algorithms and the webpage itself
2) if the fractal drawings are animated as they draw out
3) If the webpage commands successfully open new tabs dedicated to the animated fractal drawings

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule
Explain how you will go from proposal to finished product. 

There are three deliverable milestones to explicitly define, below.

The nature of deliverables depend on your project, but may include things like processed data ready for import, core algorithms implemented, interface design prototyped, etc. 

You will be expected to turn in code, documentation, and data (as appropriate) at each of these stages.

Write concrete steps for your schedule to move from concept to working system. 

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
The Webpage outline itself will be ready on Friday, April 15th, as well as the outlines of the code for all algorithms that will be drawn as fractals. 

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
The drawing algorithms will be implemented into the webpage itself for the second milestone, on April 22nd.

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
A live demonstration will be prepared for the last week, where we will display our chosen fractal drawings that we implemented into the website.

## Group Responsibilities

### Patrick Donegan @PDD-GIT
Will develop the fractal image generator. The generator will take in a set of specs from a webpage, such as the number of levels of recursion and the shapes to be used in the drawing. The image will then be created and sent out to the webpage. 

### Leonard Lambda @lennylambda
will work on...

### John Adams @jadamsuml 
John is team lead. Will be responsible for the integration between the drawings themselves, and the webpage. Will also assist the other group members where necessary.
